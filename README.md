# Guess-The-Number
A game where you have to guess the number. Console and GUI (Windows; Java and Python Cross-Platform) editions availible

For console, this is how to play:
As soon as the app starts, it will prompt you to enter a number. It will ask until you get it right or terminate the program. Once you do get it right, press a key and it should close.

For GUI, this is how to play:
Enter your number in the box, then click the "Guess" button. If you got it wrong it will show a message; if you get it right, it will show a message and once you click OK, the application will quit.

You have to download the .zip files to find the game. Go inside the programming language name (for example, Python) and find the bin folder. In there is an executable for you to run, which is the game. In the Java version, go into the "Applciation" folder instead of the "CLASS" folder. In there is a .jar file, which is runnable. In python, simply open the script with Python 3.10.4 environment.

***IF YOU DO NOT HAVE WINDOWS, THE JAVA AND PYTHON VERSIONS WORK FOR MAC AND LINUX AS LONG AS YOU HAVE JAVA SE 17.0.2 OR PYTHON 3.10.4***

Enjoy!
